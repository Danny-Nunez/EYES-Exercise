## Description
This eyes exercise uses html and CSS styles to create a set of eyes in the middle of the screen. There is code to track the userâ€™s mouse input and to have the eyes follow wherever the user is pointing. This projectâ€™s focus was to work with styling and bootstrap as well as mouse and click events.

## How to run
Download all of the files to the same directory, making sure to keep the same file structure in place. Load the index.html file in a browser to start the program. The program will start and the eyes will move as soon as the file loads.

## Future Improvements
Future improvements could include having a three . js head also follow the mouse movement and add a mouth.

## License Info
Code written by Danny Nunez using starter code from the MITxPRO full stack development bootcamp course.
